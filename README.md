# 🧠 Sign Language Recognition (SLR)

A deep learning project that converts **Arabic sign language** to **text**,  
then converts the text to **speech** using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**.

## 🎯 Project Description

This project aims to assist deaf and mute individuals by recognizing hand gestures  
using computer vision and AI, then:
1. **Detects signs via webcam using OpenCV & MediaPipe**
2. **Recognizes the sign using a trained TensorFlow model**
3. **Converts the recognized text to speech using a TTS engine**

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🧠 [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) – for training and prediction  
- 🎥 [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) – for video capture and processing  
- 🖐️ [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) – for hand tracking and landmarks  
- 🔊 TTS (e.g., `pyttsx3`, `gTTS`) – for converting text to voice
